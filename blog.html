      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my personal blog. I'm a 20 year old computer science student studying at the Faculty of Informatics and Information Technologies of the Slovak University of Technoogy in Bratislava.</p>
      <p>Things that I'm actively learning about and bettering myself at include coding, knowledge and usage of Linux, Neovim, web development and making my own site. I used to do LeetCode actively, but currently put this activity on hiatus. Currently, I try to complete at least a few exercises from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">freeCodeCamp</a> courses daily.</p>
      <p>Some of my personal, for fun, interests include video games, such as the Persona and Yakuza series, literature, mainly works from Japanese authors, and music, I have a collection of music that I'm fond of in very many genres but Vocaloid music is probably the most interesting out of them.</p>

      <h1>My projects</h1>
      <a href="https://github.com/tomasswaier/The-time-I-got-reincarnated-as-a-spaceglider" class="project-tile" target="_blank">The time I got reincanated as a spaceglider</a>
      <p>This is a non-serious project that I'm collaborating on with my partner. It's a silly visual novel using League of Legengs characters as protagonists. We are making use of <a href="https://www.renpy.org/">Ren'Py</a> for this project.</p>
      <a href="./index.html" class="project-tile" target="_blank">This site</a>
      <p>I have thought about making my own website for a few months until I actually got to working on it. I think it's an interesting mix of coding, trying to make things look nice and being able to talk about things I find fun.</p>
      <a href="./pomodoro/index.html" class="project-tile" target="_blank">Pomodoro Timer</a>
      <p>My first try at making a little something with JavaScript. Functional Pomodoro timer with start, reset, pause and resume options and a work session counter. Message changes based on the status of the timer. Pretty simple but fun either way.</p>
      <a href="https://missadora.me/keyboard_tester" class="project-tile" target="_blank">Keyboard Tester</a>
      <p>After taking online courses in JavaScript and React, I realised I could make a keyboard tester using React with the knowledge I gained. During this project I learned a lot about building React apps from scratch, node package manager and deploying React apps online using GitHub Pages. Took me less than a day to make and deploy even with some user errors throughout.</p>
