      <h2>Hyprland and ricing</h2>
    </section>

    <section id="getting-started">
      <h1>Getting started</h1>
      <p>
        The main reason I had started using Arch Linux in the first place is the
        amount of customizability that distros which mainly use Gnome don't
        offer. I had gotten it mainly to try ricing, which took me about half a
        year to get to with all my university responsibilities and my lack of
        motivation. I had an idea that I wanted to make a pretty Catppuccin
        themed rice for a little while and after browsing r/UnixPorn and seeing
        <a
          href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1h3xnao/hyprland_comfy_catppucin_rice_for_uni/"
          target="_blank"
          >this post</a
        >, I started trying to make my own.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="setting-up">
      <h1>Hyprland</h1>
      <p>
        What is <a href="https://hyprland.org/" target="_blank">Hyprland</a>? I
        hadn't the slightest idea but seeing that most posts on the
        aforementioned subreddit used Hyprland as their desktop enviroment, I
        wanted to do the same. To quote it's GitHub and save myself some
        brainpower trying to think of an explanation, "Hyprland is an
        independent, highly customizable, dynamic tiling Wayland compositor that
        doesn't sacrifice on its looks." It is a tiling window manager, which
        splits up your screen into tiles by default, as opposed to a floating
        window manager, which everyone is accustomed to, through Windows, MacOS,
        Gnome, KDE Plasma and such. This difference, as well as different
        controls through keybinds instead of using icons, takes a little to get
        used to but I haven't had issues for more than three days or so.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/hyprland2.png" />
      <p>
        When I set my mind on using Hyprland, I was a little scared to commit to
        it fully before trying it out, because of my paranoia that Arch will
        break even if I look at it the wrong way. Thankfully, it's incredibly
        easy to test. You simply download Hyprland using yay for the newest
        version:
      </p>
      <code> yay -S hyprland-git </code>
      <p>
        Load into a different TTY using Ctrl+Alt+F2 (or F3 and so on...) and
        execute the hyprland command. You'll load a Hyprland session, while
        having your original session available on TTY1, and can try configuring
        anything you'd like without being scared of messing something up and
        being stuck. Well at least I had that fear.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Utilities</h1>
      <p>
        A downside of Hyprland is that is is not very usable out of the box as
        opposed to KDE, but doing everything yourself is one of the wonders of
        Linux. An upside of Hyprland is that many of the programs you will use
        only need a .conf file to customize anything you need.
      </p>

      <h3>Terminal</h3>
      <p>
        Arguably the most important part when using Linux. I've tried a few
        terminals on both Ubuntu Gnome and Arch KDE Plasma, however I've stayed
        with the default terminal on Hyprland, which is Kitty, for its
        simplicity and minimalist looks without any bars or buttons. Kitty's
        configuration file isn't in the hypr directory within the .config/
        direcory within your user, but in its own one.
      </p>

      <h3>Wallpaper</h3>
      <p>
        The most used wallpaper utility on Hyprland is
        <a href="https://github.com/hyprwm/hyprpaper" target="_blank"
          >Hyprpaper</a
        >. I have chosen a nice looking wallpaper from
        <a
          href=" https://github.com/orangci/walls-catppuccin-mocha"
          target="_blank"
          >this GitHub repo</a
        >
        which hosts tons of Catppuccin themed wallpapers. Only thing I needed to
        do to set the wallpaper is write two lines in a .conf file and autoload
        Hyprpaper on startup.
      </p>

      <h3>Taskbar</h3>
      <p>
        There is no taskbar by default and you have to download one yourself.
        One that is used the most is
        <a href="https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar" target="_blank">Waybar</a>
        but it's very basic and seemed like it'd need a lot of work to transform
        into something good looking. The Reddit post which inspired me
        referenced
        <a href="https://hyprpanel.com/" target="_blank">Hyprpanel</a>, which
        provides a lot of visually appealing utilities out of the box, although
        at the cost of a lot of dependencies. It runs through AGSv1 at the
        moment, but as far as I'm aware, the developers are looking to migrate
        to a newer version of AGS.
      </p>

      <h3>Screenshotting</h3>
      <p>
        I'm using
        <a href="https://github.com/Gustash/Hyprshot" target="_blank"></a
        >Hyprshot with two keybindings, one for a screen selection and one for
        full screen.

      <h1>Theming and configuration</h1>
      <p>
        As I've mentioned, my goal was to get as Catppuccined as possible, which
        is easy to achieve with their incredible
        <a href="https://catppuccin.com/ports" target="_blank"
          >catalogue of ports</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>This is everywhere I used any kind of Catppuccin theming:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/kitty">Kitty</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/firefox">Firefox</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/discord"
            >Discord/BetterDiscord</a
          >
          (requires upkeep after each Discord update)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/obsidian">Obsidian</a></li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/spicetify">Spicetify</a>
          (requires upkeep after each Spotify update)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/quantumfate/wofi">Wofi</a> (note: I
          haven't really figured out how to do it properly, so I use a
          workaround in the way I load my menu in hyprland.conf)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim">Neovim</a> (this is the
          only one I've been using for a long time beforehand)
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/catppuccin/cava">Cava</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p></p>
      <p>
        As for configurations, I've shared my dotfiles in
        <a href="https://github.com/missadoramegatron/dotfiles" target="_blank"
          >this GitHub repo</a
        >. If you simply clone them, they probably won't work, as some need to
        be in their own directory (like Kitty) or include paths that are
        relevant to only my system. I'm sharing those I have personally edited
        to my own liking, when it comes to themes, you can find everything you
        need to know in their own respective repos through the Catppuccin port
        catalogue or in through the above links
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the changes I've made to my hyprland.conf is new keybinds to
        switch workspaces and move windows through workspaces, scroll through
        workspaces using keybinds, screenshotting, window border colours,
        startup applications, and so on.

      <h1>Future improvements</h1>
      <p>
        Currently, I don't lock whenever I sleep my laptop on Hyprland. I plan
        to use Hypridle to watch for when I'm idle and execute Hyprlock to lock
        me out. I'm also having issues with logging into the Eduroam Wi-Fi since
        the Hyprpanel Wi-Fi utility only allows for the password input and
        Eduroam needs both username and password. Currently I use:
      </p>
      <code
        >nmcli dev wifi list sudo <br />nmcli dev --ask wifi connect [SSID found from previous command]
      </code>
      <p>
        It's simple to write a script to automate this, but I've been too lazy.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        Overall this was an extremely pleasurable experience. I found it very
        fun to figure everything out and customize everything to my own liking.
        This is the most customization I've seen from a desktop enviroment so I
        highly reccomend this to anyone who is interested in ricing.
